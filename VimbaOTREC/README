From Stuart Beaton:

Attached is the program I modified for OTREC down camera (Allied Vision Prosilica GT4907).
Essential mod was putting in a while(1) loop. Others mods set up the camera brightness,
binning, etc. 
This is the SynchronousGrab program (VimbaC/Examples/SynchronousGrab/Source/SynchronousGrab.c),
so it sets up one buffer and requests a single image from the camera. This is called by
program.c (same directory) which pretty much just reads command line options and calls
SychronousGrab.

Examples/AsynchronousGrab might be a better starting point. It sets up multiple buffers
and the camera fills them as fast as possible, and can do other things while the buffer
is filling.

I did a little experimenting with Async...Grab on Shannons old computer with linux.
With Async and no modifications I got 6.87 frames per second using 33% of CPU according
to top. Then increased the number of frame buffers from 3 to 6, no change. But when I set
the MTU to 9000, frames/sec went up to 7.1 while CPU usage dropped to 9.8. So it might be
worthwhile, if you don't have  to go through any hubs, to enable jumbo frames on the
computer.
